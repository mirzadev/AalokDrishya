          Welcome to Chitrogolpo, a creative wedding photography team from
          Bangladesh. Our journey began more than a decade ago. In 2017, we
          formed our company with a passion for capturing the simplicity of
          people on their special day. We believe every wedding is unique & we
          tell the story through our photos. From the villages to the cities,
          weâ€™ve been documenting Bangladeshi weddings for a decade & our photos
          become more valuable with time.
